logical database are 0-index based namespaces to seperate key spaces. 
but Redis has some restrictions on them. notably, Redis cluster only supports database 0.

- SET key value [EX seconds] [PX milliseconds] [NX|XX]
	-> NX set if the key already not exists. XX set if the key already exist.

- GET key

- KEYS pattern   # searches for a key based on given pattern. it blocks database until iterated over all keys
	-> so for a heavy database with millions/billions of entries, it is not a good command

- SCAN slot [MATCH pattern] [COUNT count]   # it acts like KEYS but iterates over a cursor
	-> slot is the number of slot to start search from. 
	-> count is the number of keys that you want to force Redis to search through.
	-> when executed, it may or may not return a result. but it will certainly return a slot number that you can use 
	   in your next SCAN search. if it returns 0, then it means that there are no more keys to search through.

ex.     -> SCAN 0 MATCH *key-criteria* COUNT 1000

- DEL key [key] [key] ...   # it is a blocking process

- UNLINK key [key] [key] ...   # unlinks the key, buy memory associated with the key reclaims by an async process

- EXISTS key [key] [key] ...   

- EXPIRE key seconds
- EXPIREAT key timestamp

- PEXPIRE key milliseconds
- PEXPIREAT key milliseconds-timestamp

- TTL key   # show the expiration of the key in seconds
- PTTL key  # in milliseconds

- PERSIST key   # removes ttl

- INCR key   # will create/increment the integer value of a key by 1
- INCRBY key increment   # will increase/decrease the value of specified key by the increment value

- DECR key
- DECRBY key decrement

- INCRBYFLOAT key increment

- TYPE key   # shows specified key's value type

- OBJECT ENCODING key   # shows the encoding of the value of this key. TYPE may be str, but meanwhile encoding is int.
